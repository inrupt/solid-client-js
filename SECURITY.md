# Security policy

This library intends supporting the development of Solid applications reading and
writing data in Solid servers. Data should always be considered sensitive and
be processed with care and regards to access restrictions and personal information.

For a better separation of concerns, this library does not deal directly with
authentication. In order to make authenticated requests, one should inject a `fetch`
function compatible with the browser-native [fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch#parameters)
dealing with authentication. This may be done using Inrupt's authentication libraries
[for Node](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inrupt/solid-client-authn-node) or [for
the browser](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@inrupt/solid-client-authn-browser).
The security policy for these libraries is available in the associated [GitHub repository](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-authn-js/blob/main/SECURITY.md).

This library also exposes functions to modify data access permissions. We
strive to make the API and [documentation](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/manage-access/)
as clear and intuitive as possible, because misuse of these functions may result
in exposing data beyond what is intended. Please do open an
[issue](https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-js/issues) if you face difficulties
with our access control APIs.
