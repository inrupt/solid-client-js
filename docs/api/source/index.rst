@inrupt/solid-client API Documentation
======================================

`@inrupt/solid-client <https://npmjs.com/package/@inrupt/solid-client>`__
is a JavaScript library for accessing data and managing permissions on
data stored in Solid Pods. It provides an abstraction layer on top of
both Solid and Resource Description Framework (RDF) principles and is
compatible with the RDF/JS specification. You can use solid-client in
Node.js using either CommonJS or ESM modules, and in the browser with a
bundler like Webpack, Rollup, or Parcel.

It is part of a `family open source JavaScript
libraries <https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/>`__
designed to support developers building Solid applications.

Installation
------------

For the latest stable version of solid-client:

.. code:: bash

   npm install @inrupt/solid-client

Changelog
~~~~~~~~~

See `the release
notes <https://github.com/inrupt/solid-client-js/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md>`__.

Supported environments
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our JavaScript Client Libraries use relatively modern JavaScript, aligned with
the `ES2018 <https://262.ecma-international.org/9.0/>`__ Specification features, we
ship both `ESM <https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/esm.html>`__ and
`CommonJS <https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v16.x/api/modules.html>`__, with type
definitions for TypeScript alongside.

This means that out of the box, we only support environments (browsers or
runtimes) that were released after mid-2018, if you wish to target other (older)
environments, then you will need to cross-compile our SDKs via the use of `Babel
<https://babeljs.io>`__, `webpack <https://webpack.js.org/>`__, `SWC
<https://swc.rs/>`__, or similar.

If you need support for Internet Explorer, it is recommended to pass them
through a tool like `Babel <https://babeljs.io>`__, and to add polyfills for
e.g. ``Map``, ``Set``, ``Promise``, ``Headers``, ``Array.prototype.includes``,
``Object.entries`` and ``String.prototype.endsWith``.

Additionally, when using this package in an environment other than Node.js, you
will need `a polyfill for Node's buffer module
<https://www.npmjs.com/package/buffer>`__.

Node.js Support
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Our JavaScript Client Libraries track Node.js `LTS releases
<https://nodejs.org/en/about/releases/>`__, and support 14.x, and 16.x.
