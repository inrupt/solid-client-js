  // a Node ES module, is in the shape of a default export that is an object with all the named
  // exports as its properties.
  // This means that if we were to import the default module, our code would fail in Webpack,
  // whereas if we imported the named exports, our code would fail in Node.
  // As a workaround, we use a dynamic import. This way, we can use the same syntax in every
  // environment, where the differences between the environments are in whether the returned object
  // includes a `default` property that contains all exported functions, or whether those functions
  // are available on the returned object directly. We can then respond to those different
  // situations at runtime.
  // Unfortunately, that does mean that tree shaking will not work until N3 also provides ES modules
  // for Node, or adds a default export for Webpack. See
