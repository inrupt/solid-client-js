# These credentials determine which Pod the end-to-end tests will write data to.
# Generally, the tests should clean up after themselves, but it is advisable to
# use a Pod created specifically for running these end-to-end tests.
#
# Note: The username present in the Pod resource URL should match the username
# of the account used to generate the credentials - but just note that the
# Inrupt Enterprise Solid Server (ESS) (or more precisely the ESS IdP Broker)
# lower-cases the user's provided username when constructing their WebID, and
# therefore all resources in that user's Pod, including their private root
# resource, will contain that *lowercased* username in their URLs.
