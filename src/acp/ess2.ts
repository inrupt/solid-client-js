/**
 * :::{admonition} Experimental API
 * :class: important
 *
 * The Access Control Policies proposal has not yet been reviewed for inclusion in the Solid spec.
 * To enable early experimentation, solid-client exposes a low-level API. However, this API can and
 * will include breaking changes in non-major releases. Additionally, for most applications, a
 * higher-level API that is planned will be more applicable.
 *
 * Thus, the following export is *only* intended for experimentation by early adopters, and is not
 * recommended for production applications. Because of this, all ACP-related API's are exported on a
 * single object, which does not facilitate tree-shaking: if you use one ACP-related API, all of
 * them will be included in your bundle.
 *
 * For more information see: [Tutorial: Managing
 * Access](https://docs.inrupt.com/developer-tools/javascript/client-libraries/tutorial/manage-access/)
 * :::
 *
 * This module supports Inrupt's ESS 2.0 ACP implementation.
 *
 * This module can be imported as an object from the main package, which results
 * in tree-shaking not being supported (so all the exported APIs will likely end
 * up in your bundle). This import style is used for environments such as nextjs
 * or create-react-app.
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import { acp_ess_2 } from "@inrupt/solid-client";
 * ```
 *
 * @packageDocumentation
 * @module acp_ess_2
